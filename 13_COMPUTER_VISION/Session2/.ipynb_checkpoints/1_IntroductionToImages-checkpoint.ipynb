    "1. It's common in computer vision scenarios to have images organized in folders based on their subject, or *class*. You should familiarize yourself with the [**os**](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html) library in Python, which provides lots of ways for you to work with the file system.\n",
    "2. The [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) library provides lots of ways to display plots and images. Note in particular that if you need to display multiple images, you can create a subplot for each image, The syntax for creating a subplot can be confusing; for each subplot you need to specify:\n",
    "    - The total number of *rows* in the grid of subplots to be displayed (this value must be the same for each subplot)\n",
    "    - The total number of *columns* in the grid of subplots to be displayed (again, this must be the same for each subplot)\n",
    "    - The ordinal position of \"this\" subplot in the grid (the first subplot should be numbered 1, the second 2, and so on)\n",
    "3. In addition to the Matplotlib library, there are other common libraries for working with images:\n",
    "    - [**PIL**](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (based on the **Pillow** fork)\n",
    "    - [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/)\n",
