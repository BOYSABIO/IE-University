    "# Mid-term Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exam you will work on the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling dates and times in Python and Pandas\n",
    "* Handling text data in Pandas with regular expressions\n",
    "* Interacting with APIs to get data\n",
    "* Basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The two APIs that you will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/): an API that provides information about the International Space Station (ISS).\n",
    "* [Kanye Rest](https://kanye.rest/): an API that provides quotes from Kanye West.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- The time limit is 80 minutes.\n",
    "- Every solution must be written in Python, and the result must be printed or returned.\n",
    "- 5 minutes before the end, a warning will be given to submit what you have so far. No submissions will be accepted after the end of the exam.\n",
    "- You can resubmit as many times as you want.\n",
    "- The exam is open-book, open-notes, open-internet, open-everything except for communicating with anyone by any means, sharing solutions, or using AI in any form.\n",
    "    - The student that doesn't comply with these rules will fail immediately and reported to the university.\n",
    "- If you have a question, please raise your hand. I will come to you.\n",
    "- For every exercise with a single solution, the solution is provided, but you need to write the code to solve it.\n",
    "- If you couldn't solve an exercise and you need the solution, you can copy my solution at a penalty of 75% of the exercise's grade.\n",
    "    - E.g. on exercise 1 (1 point) you don't know the solution, but you need it for exercise 2 (1 point). You can copy the solution, but the maximum grade you can get on exercise 2 is 25% of the points. The total grade in both exercises will be 0.25 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission:\n",
    "- Before the end of the exam, submit the exam using the link provided in the mid-term exam announcement.\n",
    "- Only submit the completed notebook, no other files are needed, only the `.ipynb` file.\n"
